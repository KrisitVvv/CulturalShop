## Infomation
The project is a wechat mini program,it's base on Uniapp combined with Vue2.This is my university course assignment,It contains bugs and areas that need optimization,if you want, you’re welcome to submit your code through the PR.
## Install
This project is based on uniapp, so you need to install [HbuilderX](https://dcloud.io/hbuilderx.html) to make Vue code change into WeChat mini program code.  

We use [Vue](https://cn.vuejs.org/index.html) as the front-end framework, so you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run it.  
When you success install Node.js,you can run `npm install -g vue` to install dependencies.  
If you meet downloading speed is too slow,you can use npm mirror to speed up.
```bash
# chinese mirror
npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org
```
In addition, we also need to install the WeChat Developer Assistant,and register the Wechat Developer Account.  

This repository just front-end code,if want to run this project,you need to [CulturalShop-Server]() download backend code and set up the operating environment.Otherwise,you run the program will have error pages contain.
